# Model Theory

Sometimes a proposition is syntactically correct but can't be
evaluated for truthfulness because the meanings of some of the
symbols in the expression have not yet been given meanings. In propositional logic, the variable expressions have this property.



When we augment a proposition with a definition
of the meanings of the symbols it contains, so that the truth of
of the propostion can be determined, we are said to be giving an *interpretation* of those symbols for that proposition.

In propositional logic, an interpretation assigns a Boolean value
to each variable in a proposition. As an example, given a proposition, *P*, consisting of a single variable expression, *A*, there are just two possible interpretations for *P*, one in which *A* evaluates to *true* and one in which it evaluates to *false*.

If a proposition evaluates to *true* given ("under") an interpretation, I, then *I* is said to be a *model of P*. In thIn this case, we also say that *I satisfies P*, which we can write as *I ‚äß P*. An interpretation *I* that makes *P* false is called a *counterexample* for *P*.  

Model theory is the theory of models for expressions in any language, natural or formal, in which one can state propositions. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Logic provides a nice overview of [model theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/model-theory/) in more general terms than we can explore here.
