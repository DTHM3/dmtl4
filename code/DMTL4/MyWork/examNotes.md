# Exam 1

You have to be able to explain: (1) To
what abstract syntactic does any such expression desugar?
(2) How, exactly, do you define interpretation functions?
(3) How does semantic evaluation of any syntactically
correct expression proceed? How is pattern matching used
in this process to define a function "by cases," where
the cases are defined by a sequence of pattern matching
construct. An incoming argument value is matched against
the list of patterns in the given order. The first one
that matches the value is used to "destructure" the value
(opening the box and naming the objects on the inside so
those constituent objects can be used in computing the
result that needs to be returned. (4)
