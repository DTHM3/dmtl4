# Languages

1. Elements  
   1. Syntax: Symbols and symbolic expressions
   2. Semantic domain: things (Denotations) that symbols/expressions can mean  
   3. Interpretation: mappinvg from symbols and expressions to these meanings  
   4. Moods  
      1) Declarative (indicative) – statement asserting what **is** the case  
      2) Conditional –statement asserting what **is** **if** a particular condition holds
      3) Optative – statement defining a state that **should be** made to prevail  
      4) Imperative – expresses a **command** to carry out a certain action  
      5) Exclamatory – an expression of a strong **emotional** state of affairs  
      6) Subjunctive – expresses uncertainty or **counterfactual**
      7) Interrogative – asks a **question**  
2. Some Purposes/Uses of Language
   1. Human-Human Communication
   2. Human-Machine Communication
   3. Machine-Machine Communication
   4. Support Learning and Reasoning  
   5. Computer-Automated Reasoning  
3. Natural vs Formal Languages  
   1. Natural (but still symbolic: spoken, written, signed):
      1) enables and facilitates human communication  
      2) rich but ambiguous, imprecise
         1) shoes must be worn, dogs must be carried  
      3) not sufficiently computable (LLMs are an advance)  
   2. Formal (logic, mathematics, programming languages)  
      1) essential support for rigorous and mechanized reasoning
      2) harder for human expression, understanding, communication
      3) Many and diverse examples
4. Formal Languages
   1. Imperative  
   2. Declarative  
   3. Expressiveness
   4. Tradeoffs
5. Imperative  
   1. Step by step procedure to solve a problem
   2. States, commands, and effects
   3. Example: Python program for square root using Newton’s method  
6. Declarative  
   1) Syntax and Semantics
   2) Domains and Interpretations  
   3) Models: Validity, Satisfiability, Unsatisfiability  
   4) Expressiveness vs Solvability
   5) Expressiveness vs Efficiency  
7. Declarative Formal Languages  
8. Quality Tradeoffs  
   1. Expressiveness  
   2. Computational complexity of reasoning
      1) Decidability of validity of arbitrary expressions  
      2) Tractability of such a computation
