# Discrete Mathematics and Theory in Lean 4

This course, developed and tested by Kevin Sullivan at the University of Virginia. It is
intended as a model for replacing the second course for undergraduate computer science (CS)
majors--a course typically in discrete mathematics and theory--across the board. Such a course
typically covered propositional and first-order predicate logic and set theory eextended with
natural number arithmetic and maybe a few other such theories.


This course delivers essentially all of the logical and mathematical concepts covered in 
such a course but now in a precise, abstract, automated  matheamtical language and notation. It employs the higher-order logic and toolset of Lean 4. It has also been refined through multiple offerings to reduce the coverage of Lean to a minimum to ensure that students are not overly
distracted from the core mathematical and logical concepts at the heart of any course in DM.
The course is also meant to prepare students to compete for jobs in the small but now growing
market for programmers in Lean 4 and related languages.

Finally, this course is also intended as a first major segment of a graduate course in
formal and automated logical and mathematical expression and reasoning. Anecdotally,
almost none of the PhD or MS students entering the CS department at my institution have
a useful background in these area. Of 38 graduate students in Spring 2025, close to zero
were able to confidently reason about the truth-functional definition of impication. I
take this as a sign that our field is failing undergraduate CS students when it comes
to effective education in fundamental concepts and uses of logic, proof, set theory, and
precise, abstract, mathematical reasoning more generally.

From here, advanced courses in several areas are possible at both undergraduate and graduate levels, including programming language design and implementation, certified software engineering, compilers, machine learning (e.g., of discrete structures) from examples, formalization of higher mathematics, and formalization of physics, AI, robotics, and other domains that require sophsticated mathematics.
