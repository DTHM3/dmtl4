# Model Theory

The semantics of propositional logic enable the
evaluation an expression under an interpretation.
An interpretation for proposition logic, in turn,
is *in the form of a function:* from the variables
in the expression to Boolean values.

The idea that we can evaluate an expression in some
logic over some *structure* that essentially fills 
in missing values (here values to be assigned to the
variable expressions) is general and reappears in a
variety of other logics. 

These structures are not always functions, however,
but can be more complex objects. The interested student
might want to explore these ideas as they arise in the
context of *temporal logics.* Here expressions can be
evaluated over a different kind of structure, called
a Kripke structure. Nevertheless, key idea remain the
same, particularly the notion that an interpretation
under which an expression is true is called a model
for that expression. 

In this chapter we stick to evaluating expressions
in propositional logic over interpretation functions.
The reader should however be aware of the fact that
the ideas presented here are more broadly relevant.
